Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year (Any time of year) You can find it here  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.

Would you have been a little genius in love with math? Would you have played in your school clothes and made me mad? Would you have been a little rapper like your papa da Piper? Would you have made me quit smokin' by finding one of my lighters? I wonder about your skintone and shape of your nose? And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow?

I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption.  I planned each charted course; Each careful step along the byway, But more, much more than this, I did it my way.  Yes, there were times, Im sure you knew [ My Way lyrics found on http://lyrics.my ] When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all, when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out.

To think I did all that; And may I say - not in a shy way, No, oh no not me, I did it my way.  For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught.

Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by, Now I'm comtemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that Im late.

[Verse 2:] It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call, The more I want to tell them that I'm not involved, With anyone, when I know it's you, Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do, Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy It's the reason I won't tell em i got a lady, Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that Im late.

But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried, As he reached down To close Susie's eyes... She lie there so tenderly [ Little Susie lyrics found on http://lyrics.my ] Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care, Oh the blood in her hair...  It was all for God's sake For her singing the tune, For someone to feel her despair. To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed Then to scream out And nobody's there... She knew no one cared...  Father left home, poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather's soul too had flown... No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear, Rejecting the needs in her prayers...  Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul, Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care, So young and so fair.", "url": "https://www.lyrics.my/artists/michael-jackson/lyrics/little-susie", "name": "Michael Jackson", "title": "Little Susie"}

And as they led him to the dock, he knew that he'd been wronged. \"You stand accused of robbery,\" he heard the bailiff say. He knew without an alibi, tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.  Over the hills and far away, for ten long years he'll count the days. Over the mountains and the seas, a prisoner's life for him there'll be.  He knew that it would cost him dear, but yet he dare not say. Where he had been that fateful night, a secret it must stay. He had to fight back tears of rage. His heart beat like a drum. For with the wife of his best friend, he spent his final night of freedom.  Over the hills and far away, he swears he will return one day. Far from the mountains and the seas, [ Over The Hills And Far Away lyrics found on http://lyrics.my ] back in her arms he swears he'll be. Over the hills and far away.

When did all our lessons start to look like weapons Pointed at my deepest hurt? I hope she'll be your beautiful fool Who takes my spot next to you No, I didn't mean that Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury You haven't met the new me yet  There'll be happiness after me But there was happiness because of me Both of these things, I believe There is happiness  In our history, across our great divide There is a glorious sunrise Dappled with the flickers of light From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind And there is happiness  I can't make it go away by making you a villain I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven And I pulled your body into mine Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties No one teaches you what to do When a good man hurts you And you know you hurt him, too  Honey, when I'm above the trees I see it for what it is But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head After giving you the best I had Tell me what to give after that All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness You haven't met the new me yet And I think she'll give you that  There'll be happiness after you But there was happiness because of you, too Both of these things can be true There is happiness  In our history, across our great divide There is a glorious sunrise Dappled with the flickers of light From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind Oh, leave it all behind Leave it all behind And there is happiness", "url": "https://www.lyrics.my/artists/taylor-swift/lyrics/happiness", "name": "Taylor Swift", "title": "Happiness"}

I swear you could hear a hair pin drop Right when I felt the moment stop Glass shattered on the white cloth Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there Dust collected on my pinned up hair They expected me to find somewhere Some perspective, but I sat and stared Right where you left me  You left me no, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever You left me, you left me no, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever  Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen? Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy How it was supposed to be Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? Breakups happen every day, don't have to lose it She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy And you're sitting in front of me  At the restaurant when I was still the one you want Cross-legged in the dim light Everything was just right, I... I could feel the mascara run You told me that you met someone Glass shattered on the white cloth Everybody moved on  Help, I'm still at the restaurant Still sitting in a corner I haunt Cross-legged in the dim light They say, \"What a sad sight\", I... I stayed there Dust collected on my pinned up hair I'm sure that you got a wife out there Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware Cause I'm right where I cause no harm Mind my business If our love died young I can't bear witness And it's been so long But if you ever think you got it wrong  I'm right where You left me You left me no, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever You left me You left me no, you left me no You left me no choice but to stay here forever", "url": "https://www.lyrics.my/artists/taylor-swift/lyrics/right-where-you-left-me", "name": "Taylor Swift", "title": "Right Where You Left Me"}
